                      Tuzigoot National Monuments


The National Park Service protects many historical areas in the
southwestern United States. Montezuma Castle and Tuzigoot are just two
of these sites.

Now that you are an official Junior Park Ranger we hope that you will
continue to help us protect these special places so that others who come
after you may enjoy them also.

                As a Junior Park Ranger your duties are:


—To help keep your parks clean! Do not litter. If you find any litter,
  help out by putting it in a trash container.

—To learn more about your parks! Information can be found in visitor
  centers and museums. You may also ask the Park Rangers questions. Be
  sure to share your new knowledge with friends when you get home.

—To obey all rules and signs! Rules in the parks are for your safety and
  also to protect the resources. Please stay on the trails.

                          Pick a Pair of Pots


People learn about the past from looking at things that were left
behind. The people who lived at Montezuma Castle and Tuzigoot left lots
of pottery.

Below are some pots. Two of them are exactly the same. Look at them
closely, then circle (or mark the checkbox for) the matching pair.

People were not the only ones who lived here. Many animals also make
their homes around here. Can you draw a line from each animal to the
name of its home? Also circle any animals or homes that you see while
you are visiting.

                              Then and Now


People lived at Montezuma Castle and Tuzigoot many years ago. They did
not have electricity, grocery stores or even metal. These past people
made the things needed for themselves. Today people usually buy things
that have already been made.

Below are many objects. Draw an X through each object that would not
have been available to the people who lived here.

    [Illustration: Ancient and modern artifacts]




                              You Decide!


The Sinagua (seen-AH-wa) Indians lived in this area for a long time.
After living here many years, the people left. Did something change that
forced them to leave? People today are trying to learn why they went
away.

                        NO ONE KNOWS THE ANSWER

This is your chance to tell us what you think happened to the Sinagua
Indians. People have guessed that a disease may have killed them, a
drought (no rain for a long time) could have destroyed their crops, too
many people living in one place may have used up all the food and
firewood or they may have been attacked by some other tribe. Look at the
exhibits and walk the trail to learn more about the Sinagua Indians.

In the space below write out your own story of why they left.

  The Sinagua Indians left because....







                            Plants Provided


The Sinagua Indians who lived here years ago depended on nature to
supply their needs. Plants provided food, building material, medicine
and clothing.

While you are visiting, look at the different plants. Many are the same
type that people used when they lived here. Four plants are listed
below, along with how they were used. See if you can find and draw 3 of
these 4.

                                     There are different types of
                                     yucca but all provided necessary
                                     items. Fibers from the leaves of
                                     these plants were woven into
                                     baskets, mats, ropes and
                                     sandals. Soap was made from the
                                     roots.

                Yucca

  The gum (or sap) of this tree
  was used to make a candy as well
  as to mend broken pottery. Its
  beans were crushed and made into
  a flour.

                                               Mesquite Tree

                                     This tree was used in building
                                     homes. The wood remains very
                                     strong for hundreds of years.

            Sycamore Tree

  This bush had many uses. The
  root was chewed and put on ant
  bites and bee stings. The
  blossoms and twigs were used to
  make a bright yellow dye.

                                                 Salt Bush

                           How Old Are They?


Montezuma Castle and Tuzigoot are both older than anyone living today.
Since the Sinagua Indians left no written records, these buildings are
considered prehistoric (before recorded history).

After finishing this page you will learn how many years ago people were
living here and how long ago they left. These monuments have been
studied by archeologists (ar-key-ALL-o-jists). An archeologist is a
person who studies past people and their ways of life by looking at
artifacts (AR-te-fakts). Artifacts are things that have been left
behind.


The Sinagua Indians, who lived here, left behind pottery, jewelry and
tools. The artifacts found here were compared to those found in other
monuments. By comparing them, archeologists were able to figure out when
people lived in these buildings.

Look in the park brochure and read the signs along the trail to find the
dates you need. Fill in the dates below and subtract.

intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
